<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons clarified butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon clarified butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Place steak between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound to a ¼-inch thickness. Season one side generously with salt and pepper, then sprinkle ½ of the bread crumbs over top. Place the plastic wrap back over the steak and pound a few times with the meat mallet. Repeat to season the other side with salt, pepper, and remaining bread crumbs.</li>
    <li>Set a pan over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons melted clarified butter and wait until it starts to smoke. Quickly and carefully add steak to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Flip steak and reduce heat to medium-high; cook until you see a little bit of pink juice pool on top of the steak, about 1 more minute. Flip again, turn off the heat, and transfer steak to a warm plate.</li>
